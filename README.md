# Modelling ML
 
 This is Modelling ML, a code-free Machine Learning (ML) tool presented in a Graphical user interface (GUI) 
 which covers the most important steps in the design of Classification and Regression Machine Learning models.
 <!--
 The idea behind this tool came initially from a personal need where I needed to quickly perform some pre-processing, 
 visualisation and training ML models from datasets in .csv and Microsoft Excel (.xls and .xlsx) format.
 -->
 Modelling ML is 100% coded in Python 3 and uses some of the most popular libraries for Data Science and ML such as 
 [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html#),
 [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Numpy](https://numpy.org/), etc. The GUI was built on top of 
 [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) using PyQt5. 
 
 
This project is in constant development. Hence, make sure you use the latest version and feel free to report any bugs. 
There is a **To-do List** in the bottom of this page and suggestions are welcomed.

If you want to get involved in this project, please, feel free to contribute by submitting your pull request.
 

#### Versions
* 1.0 - Better done than Perfect (Current)

#### For running Modelling ML
1. Run [src/main.py](https://github.com/matheusft/modelling_ml/tree/master/src/main.py)

#### For updating anything in the GUI 
1. Use [Qt Designer](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html) to update the files from [resources/ui](https://github.com/matheusft/modelling_ml/tree/master/resources/ui). 
(Trust me, you don't want to build a GUI using code).
2. Run [src/convert_ui_to_py.py](https://github.com/matheusft/modelling_ml/tree/master/src/convert_ui_to_py.py) 
(Do not fiddle with [src/view.py](https://github.com/matheusft/modelling_ml/tree/master/src/view.py) nor 
[src/ml_gui_resources_rc.py](https://github.com/matheusft/modelling_ml/tree/master/src/ml_gui_resources_rc.py). Let
the [pyuic5](https://pypi.org/project/pyqt5ac/) package called in [src/convert_ui_to_py.py](https://github.com/matheusft/modelling_ml/tree/master/src/convert_ui_to_py.py)
 do its jobs.)

Ideally, this tool should be self-explanatory...

> A user interface (UI) is like a joke. If you have to explain it, itâ€™s not that good

In case this UI fails to achieve the same level as a nice joke, please, check below for some extra info regarding each 
separate tab from Modelling ML.

### Loading a Dataset:

In the first tab of Modelling ML you can either select an example dataset from the dropdown box or load a dataset
from a file. Currently, the file extensions accepted are .csv, .xls and .xlsx.

In V1.0, Modelling ML works better with datasets that contain the variable labels in the top row and a single data type 
per column. Funny datasets with multiple data types in each column may cause Modelling ML to get very angry and explode 
&#128165;. 

This should be improved in the future.

### Visualising the loaded Dataset:

The visualisation tab displays some basic plots and a summary of the variable chosen in dropdown box.

#### To-do List:
* Add a Testing Tab
* Add more example Datasets
* Accept file extensions other than (.csv, .xls and .xlsx)
* Handle Unusual Datasets files
* Add other Pre-Processing options
* Display Pre-Processed and Original Dataset in the Visualisation Tab (Combobox)
* Generate Executable files for Windows and macOS.
